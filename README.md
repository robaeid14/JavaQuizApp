# Quiz App Project

A Java-based quiz application that allows users to take quizzes on various topics, including MySQL, database management, and other technical topics. This project is a simple but fully functional quiz system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using JavaFX and a backend database (MySQL) to store questions, users, and quiz attempt data.

   - View user quiz attempts and scores.

3. **Quiz Functionality**:
   - Users can select the number of questions for each quiz session.
   - Questions are randomly selected and displayed one by one.
   - Submit quiz results to view the score and compare it to the total number of questions.

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Stores questions, user credentials, and quiz attempts in a MySQL database.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Input validation for question fields, answers, and number of questions for quizzes.

## Project Structure

- **DBConnection**: Handles MySQL database connection setup.
- **QuestionManager**: Manages question operations (CRUD operations).
- **QuizManager**: Manages quiz functionality, including loading questions and scoring.
- **UserManager**: Manages user registration, authentication, and role management.
- **QuizAppGUI**: Main GUI class that controls the scenes, navigation, and user interactions.

---

## Design and Architecture

The project is designed with a modular architecture where each functionality is encapsulated in separate classes:
- **Database Layer**: Provides a MySQL-based persistence layer with `DBConnection` managing connections.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Classes like `QuestionManager`, `QuizManager`, and `UserManager` handle the core logic of the application.
- **Presentation Layer**: `QuizAppGUI` handles the GUI interactions and displays the scenes for user and admin actions.

---

## Database Schema

The application uses a MySQL database named `quizdb` with the following schema:

- **`users` Table**: Stores user information, including username, password, and role.
- **`questions` Table**: Stores question details, including options and the correct answer.
- **`quiz_attempts` Table**: Logs quiz attempt details for each user, including score and time taken.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE quizdb;
USE quizdb;

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    role ENUM('user', 'admin') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE questions (
    question_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    option_1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    option_2 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    option_3 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    option_4 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    correct_option INT NOT NULL CHECK (correct_option BETWEEN 1 AND 4),
    created_by INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE quiz_attempts (
    attempt_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    score INT,
    attempted_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    time_taken INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```
